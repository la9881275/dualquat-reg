The demo simulates a process in which a collection of rangemaps along a ring
topology are pairwise-aligned with an ICP-like process. This process inevitably
induces alignment error accumulation on the view graph, which is then globally
minimized with the dual quaternion method.

Note that the demo makes use of a mesh structure only for the sake of visualization
and testing. The actual library does not need mesh data at any point of the optimization.
