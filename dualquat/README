The code implements dual quaternions diffusion for multiview registration as described in the paper cited below. The package also includes code for a small demo application demonstrating its very simple usage. This exact code was used for the experiments in the paper, so it should be very efficient and very accurate; if results are not as good as expected feel free to contact me. If you use this code, please cite the paper:
